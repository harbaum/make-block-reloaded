# Make:Block reloaded

This repository contains the source code for the updated Make:Block
project as published in [Make 04/2016](http://www.heise.de/make/inhalt/2016/4/52/).

The `orig` subdirectory contains a Linux environment to run the original
sketch publsihed in [Make 01/2015](http://www.heise.de/make/inhalt/2015/1/12/)
directly on a Linux PC. This setup simplifies development and is the 
foundation of a totally rewritten game engine.
