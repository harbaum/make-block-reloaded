# Make:Block reloaded

This repository contains the source code for the updated Make:Block
project as published in [Make 04/2016](https://shop.heise.de/katalog/make-block-reloaded).

The `orig` subdirectory contains a Linux environment to run the original
sketch publsihed in [Make 01/2015](http://www.heise.de/make/inhalt/2015/1/12/)
directly on a Linux PC. This setup simplifies development and is the 
foundation of a totally rewritten game engine.

Stay tuned ...
